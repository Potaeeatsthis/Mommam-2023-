# Mommam [2023]

My "MomMam" project, which is my M.6 final project.
By taking a sample of the soil, it is possible to determine whether the area is productive and recommend the best crop to the user.

It is suggested by recommened_crop.ipynb the plant the user should grow.
ModelSoilClassifitin.py indicates the kind of soil that is there.
Similar to ModelSoilClassifitin.py, no_cam_classicication.ipynb only requires picture input.
